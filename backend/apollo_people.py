"""Apollo-native company roster — server-side, no browser.

Apollo's People Search API (`mixed_people/api_search`) is FREE on the Professional
plan and returns a company's full roster, but names/emails are masked there (you get
id + first name + obfuscated last + title). The People Enrichment API
(`people/bulk_match`) unmasks a person by their Apollo id — full name, work email,
LinkedIn URL, phone — at 1 credit each.

So this module: search (free) → rank by title → reveal the top `max_reveal` by id
(budgeted, high-value first) → emit live. Unrevealed people stay a count only.

NOTE the endpoint: it's `mixed_people/api_search`, NOT `mixed_people/search` — the
latter is the gated internal/UI endpoint and 403s even on paid API keys.
